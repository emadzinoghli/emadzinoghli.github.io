    We are developing a Python-based software designed for simulating and analyzing bosonic (optical) quantum communication schemes. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive library capable of simulating quantum internet protocols in realistic scenarios, offering a wide range of performance metrics and statistics. This software is a product of the newly established Sharif Quantum Software Lab, dedicated to advancing research and innovation in quantum technologies.

    It is the code for my research internship at <abbr title="Technical University of Munich"> TUM </abbr> on the subject of <q>Identification codes via prime numbers.</q> It is comprised of two parts. The first part simulates a discrete memoryless channel given its characteristics. The second part is a prime generation algorithm using the GMP library. It is currently private.

    <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a website of mathematical problems and challenges that can be efficiently programmed. The goal is that by solving these question one becomes familiar with different areas of mathematics by analyzing the structure of the objects. You may "friend" on project euler with my key <code>1625677_3Z9KgJ1c6NknpqYtjIlEGcgbKCE2l0TZ</code>.
