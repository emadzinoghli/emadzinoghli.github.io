<h1> Research </h1>
    {%- capture desc -%}
    A research internship at <abbr title="Technical University of Munich"> TUM </abbr> on the subject of <q>Identification codes via prime numbers.</q> I improved the Ahlswede's 3-step algorithm for producing identification from exponential time to polynomial time, first by using pseudoprime generation algorithms and secondly by using tighter probability of errors. These modification also make the transmitter and receiver circuit much simpler. I was advised by Ph.D. Mohammad Javad Salariseddigh.
