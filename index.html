            <h1> About me </h1>
            <p>
                I am Emad Zinoghli, a Master's student at Sharif University of Technology, studying computer
                science. I received my bachelor's from Sharif Univeristy of Technology in Computer Engineering.
                I am interested quantum computing and information theory and theoretical computer science like complexity theory.

    <h3> Research Interest</h3>
    <p> My research interests are focused on the intersection of quantum science and computer science.  </p>
    <ul> 
        <li> Quantum communication</li>
        <li> Quantum cryptography and QKD </li>
        <li> Quantum computation and algorithms </li>
    </ul>
    <p> I am also interested, though to a lesser extent, in the non-quantum of computer science.. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Post-quantum cryptography: mostly lattice- and code-based and a bit of isogeny-based. </li>
        <li> Complexity theory</li>
        <li> Information theory, coding theory, and some post-Shannon</li>
        <li> Cryptography</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Other Hobbies</h3>
    <h4> Linguistic</h4>
    <p>  In my view, linguistics is the most fascinating subject within the humanities as it encompasses so many diverse aspects. It includes history, culture, interesting puzzles and intellectual problems, and at times it can be quite philosophical.
        <br>
        As an Iranian, I am particularly interested in the evolution of Persian, the most widely spoken Iranian language. More specifically, I consider myself a Persian Purist which is a movement dedicated to revitalizing the Persian language. We seek to preserve the linguistic integrity of Persian by reintroducing ancient and often forgotten Middle Persian words and by constructing new terms as substitutes for foreign loanwords. Personally, my ultimate goal is to use more original Persian words within scientific and technological contexts. 
    </p>
    <h4> Mysticism and Esotericism </h4>
    <p> 
        The cool version of philosophy. Persian mysticism and Western esotericism are the hidden treasures that I am glad I was able to find. Both are misunderstood and sometimes even forbidden. Yet still, they are sources of EXTREMELY COOL ideas and viewpoints that can not be found in the more mainstream beliefs.

    <h4> Sports </h4>
    <p> 
        Every now and then, I go to the gym, swim, and maybe play badminton.
