            <p>
                I am Emad Zinoghli, a fourth-year undergraduate at Sharif University of Technology, studying computer
                engineering. I am interested quantum computing and information theory, theoretical computer science like complexity theory, and
                cryptography.

        <h3> Research Interest</h3>
        <p> Pretty much anything that starts with a 'Q' catches my eyes  &#128513; &#128513;. That is why during my undergraduate years, I have learned about theoretical aspects and practical applications and implementation of quantum technologies. As a result, I have become intimately familiar with </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Quantum error correcting codes</li>
            <li> Quantum communication channels</li>
            <li> Quantum cryptography (QKD)</li>
            <li> Optical quantum communication schemes</li>
            <li> Quantum computation and algorithms</li>
            <li> <abbr title="Yes, it does not start with a 'Q' but I got too deep before knowing that &#128517;&#128517;. Although, in truth I really wanted and still want to break &#128520; them or prove their security &#128519;">  Post-quantum cryptography </abbr> mostly lattice- and code-based and a tad bit of isogeny-based. </li>
        </ul>
    <p> I also have gotten my hands dirty with </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantum and good ol' complexity theory</li>
        <li>Model thoery and finite model theory</li>
        <li>Good ol' information theory, coding theory, and some post-Shannon</li>
        <li>Good ol' cryptography</li>
    </ul>
